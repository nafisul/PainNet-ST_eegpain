# PainNet-ST

A spatiotemporal convolutional neural network for EEG-based pain classification.

## Overview

PainNet-ST is a deep learning model that classifies pain intensity (Low, Medium, High) 
from EEG signals with 92.25% accuracy on unseen subjects.

## Key Features

- **Spatiotemporal architecture**: Separates spatial and temporal processing
- **Hierarchical temporal scales**: Captures both short (240ms) and long (960ms) patterns
- **Optimized hyperparameters**: Learning rate 6.15e-4, dropout 58.7%
- **Production-ready**: Validated on 223 subjects, 20K+ trials
